## Final thoughts

You can find the public URL of your Web app in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) **_Hosting_** menu. By default, Firebase generates two links. Click on one of them to see your live Web app.

You may experience some loading time during the first few minutes because the Firebase infrastructure needs some time to warm up.
